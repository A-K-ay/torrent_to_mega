# Download Torrent Files directly to the Mega Cloud Drive.

Seeding/accessing Torrents directly can cause problems in some areas. This allows users to directly download the torrent file to a Mega drive and then download it from there.

To run this you can use Google Colab or any VM that has Python installed.

## Google Colab Usage

Step 1: [Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/A-K-ay/torrent_to_mega/blob/main/torrent_to_mega_downloader.ipynb)

Step 2: Add your credentials and then run the blocks sequentially.
